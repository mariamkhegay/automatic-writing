    <p>Design is the practice of conceiving and planning what does not exist. It is a broad term that can be applied to creating structures, environments, interfaces, products and services, features and processes. “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” Steve Jobs. A designer is someone who produces design. As a designer you have the power to shape the world in which we live in. Designers do research and collect information about the problem they are considering: who is a person facing this problem? Why? How are other people trying to solve it? From this research, they make a general hypothesis and identify the main features .

        Where does design begin its routs?
It of course begins centuries and decades ago. The origins of graphic design can be traced from the origins of human existence, from the caves of Lascaux, to Rome's Trajan's Column to the illuminated manuscripts of the Middle Ages, to the neon lights of Ginza, Tokyo. In "Babylon, artisans pressed cuneiform inscriptions into clay bricks or tablets which were used for construction. Though the term graphic design was coined by William Addison Dwiggins in 1922. The boarders between Fine art, advertising and graphic design had disappeared in the 20th and 21st centuries with the explosion of visual communication. Graphic design grew together with consumerism.

Design has become more complex and at the same time easy with the creation of smartphones and new technology. Design has many branches, which carry different ideas and aims. UX and UI design came up on the market and strongly influenced the world of design and it involves psychology not only the visual aspect but the way customer interacts with the app for example and design in general as well as the objects.
UX design is a very important thing in nowadays design world. Everything has to be well analyzed and better described in order to create a connection and understanding between the audience and the design
Psychology is an important tool to create the design. Taking into account social media such as Facebook and Instagram, they are using gambling methods to create psychological cravings that affect the viewer and creates addiction like cocaine. Social media grabs attention of the audience to create a habit to check the screens constantly. Psychology in design is a strong tool to create a visual composition or a message for a designer. So what is the future of design in 21 century and what tools make it better or worse?

  Artificial intelligence has come on the market of a design, which might have become a global problem for an older generation of designers and relief for a new wave of designers in terms of working with new technology, new programs and grovel to a new world of design. It simplifies design and affects the way designers have to think in order to create something new. Artificial intelligence simplifies the task for a designer, by finding relevant information and sources and can collect the data for a design that saves time. The design will not exist in the same form as it was in the past, because there is always something new on the market to explore, mobility and adaptation are the keys for a designer to develop these days apart of creativity research and analyses. Starting from 3D printing ending with readymade platforms for websites and the same for a logo design. All these spheres have been developed to the point when it is easy to create design even for a person who is not a designer. Here is the danger, because it scares that AI will reach to the point when designers will no longer exist as this profession can be taken by machines, robots and  programs.

    Mobile apps started appearing in 2008 and within a decade they grew to millions. These apps have showed people a new perception of what is possible compare to what they can imagine. Businesses have changed their strategies, nowadays a good business can rely on a good app and depend on it.  The UX and UI design along with great technology is the only thing that can sustain their business growth.

But UX design goes hand by hand with UI, these two spheres of a design are responsible for the apps and perception of the design for a user.

      Designers struggle because of the huge competition there is a lot of uneducated people in this sphere, most, of course depends on a talent and a good portfolio. Unfortunately, there are self-educated designers that have not enough knowledge and principles of what design is and how to analyze and give depth and meaning in this field. Their works can be superficial and there is not enough depth, meaning and logical structure, while a well-educated designer can often explain why and what choices he made and logically structure the whole idea. “I am a painter and that is how I see “ is a very popular phrase but for a designer, it is not enough, we have to go through a research, meaning, and history, and create an idea behind the work and explain it, it is a huge process from point A to point B. "Design is not about interacting with a computer; it's about interacting with the world."  "To deal with today's large, complex problems, design education needs to change to include multiple disciplines, technology, art, the social sciences, politics, and business." Said the Director of The Design Lab at the University of California, San Diego, Norman. This statement proofs that design is much more rather than a picture or a visual look sometimes. It is more about the way the user interacts with the idea that designer tries to bring into the world sometimes.

        You can learn the basics of design by reading different blogs and learning through Youtube. It is not so difficult for some people to learn programs and gain knowledge through different sources. Though it is not always right to do so, because internet is filled with tons of information and not all of it is right, some people write about their experience and knowledge, but it is not always the best way to rely on this experience. There are also great articles from well known designers and teachers from great institutions that can affect the vision and perception of a designer. Universities are made so that the student can be guided through the right sources, they receive a valuable information and go through the history of the design and learn  specific tools which can only be taught with special equipment and knowledge, they also teach how to establish yourself in a design world, what path to take and where to start.

          Inspiration is an important tool for an artist and it is difficult sometimes to create something new from your imagination. Though this is not a problem for a 21 century because most people recreate something that has been existed before. Many famous designers look for inspiration in the works of art, colours,  compositions and meanings. It can be renaissance art or minimalism, it also can be performance art, theatres, music , Dadaism, poems and etc. Talking about something more simple it is internet, google images, different websites with the stock images like pinterest for example. These all sources can help you to get an inspiration that was lost. By recreating you can create something really great and interesting. There is no point in creating a vehicle again. Though it might become a big problem in terms of a progress as it is important for new things to come on the market. Everything might loose their individuality and have the same structure and look the same, that is where a professional designer can win, because he knows the basics and has more options to navigate in the field of the design, while not educated designer can use same platforms and easier ways to create a website for example by using readymade platforms and it would look similar to what  people can find in the internet. It all of course depends on the imagination and skills of a designer.

  Freelance is self-employed and hired to work for different companies on particular assignments.In the 1970s a group of economists came up with a new idea, their neo-liberal model was that growth and development depended on market competitiveness, everything was based on maximizing competition and competitiveness and to allow principles spread in all aspects of life. This affected a big growth in the development of technology which affected the world of design. The precariat is now used in academic literature and journalism to refer to the class of semi-employed members of the population. Freelance has become precariat officially in 2001by G8 protests in Genoa. Freelance is no longer excepted as a real job, which is not fair for a designer as his job is not excepted seriously if he is not working for a Google or an advertising agency for example. Most designers can not find a good place to work, so they have an other option which is to work as a freeelance but it is not very perspective.
